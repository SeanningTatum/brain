# Progress — Rolling session log

> Single rolling log of "where am I right now". Append-only. Newest entry on top. **Per-task deep state lives in `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<task-slug>.md`** — this file is the index/state cursor.

## How to use

- **Start of session**: read the top entry to recover state.
- **During session**: append one bullet per meaningful checkpoint (decision, blocker, branch switch, test failure, scope change).
- **End of session**: add a `## Session end` block with: branch, last commit SHA, what's running/incomplete, what to do next.
- **Multi-day task**: link to the run note (`runs/<date>-<slug>.md`) for full detail. Keep entries here under ~5 lines each.

## Format per entry

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (UTC) — <one-line summary>
- branch: <branch-name>
- in-progress feature: <feat-id> | none
- run note: <path or none>
- next: <one sentence>
```
